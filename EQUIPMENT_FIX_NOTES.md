# Equipment System Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed:

1. **Equipment Node Reference**: Updated player.gd to look for "Node2D_Equipment" node
2. **Player Group**: Added player to "player" group in scene file  
3. **Animation System**: Equipment sprites now automatically start playing "idle" animation when equipped
4. **Auto-equip Logic**: Equipment service now auto-equips items from inventory on startup
5. **Debug Output**: Added extensive logging to track what's happening

## How It Should Work Now:

1. **Game Starts**: 
   - InventoryData gives player: blue_pants, blue_skirt, boots, green_pants, health_potion
   - Player equipment service auto-equips first available clothing item (blue_pants or blue_skirt)

2. **Equipment Display**:
   - Body sprite: Shows body animations (always visible)
   - Clothes sprite: Shows equipped clothing item animations
   - Both sprites play synchronized animations (idle, walk, run, attack, etc.)

3. **Animation Flow**:
   - Player movement → player.gd calls equipment_service.play_animation() → all sprites play matching animation

## Current Limitations:

- **Single Clothing Layer**: All clothing items (pants, boots, shirts) use the same sprite layer
- **One Item at a Time**: Only one clothing item can be visually equipped at once
- **Future Enhancement**: Need separate sprite layers for different clothing types

## Test Instructions:

1. Run the game
2. Check console output for equipment debug messages
3. Player should show:
   - Body animations playing
   - Either blue pants or blue skirt equipped and animating
4. Test movement - animations should change (idle → walk → run)
5. Test attack (J key) - attack animation should play

## If Still Not Working:

Check console output for error messages like:
- "Equipment manager starting..."
- "Sprite references - Body: ..."
- "Auto-equipping starting items..."
- "Equip result for [item]: [true/false]"

This will help diagnose exactly where the issue is occurring.
